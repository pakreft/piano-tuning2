# ReadMe PianoTune

PianoTune is an application that teaches you how to tune a (grand) piano yourself. 
In daily life, this can be a time consuming and expensive thing to do. 
Generally you have to hire a professional but with PianoTune that is all in the past.

This project was developed by two students Pawel Kreft and Soe Ã–nder in the course Computer Graphics and Animation at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamburg, Germany.

A special thanks to Sarin for his amazing 3D grand piano model on *cgtrader* (linked below)!
